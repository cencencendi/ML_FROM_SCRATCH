# Machine Learning Algorithm From Scratch.

Welcome to the Machine Learning From Scratch repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to building basic machine learning algorithms from the ground up, focusing on understanding the mechanics behind each algorithm. Inspired by the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style of SKLearn, this repository is perfect for those looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning concepts and applications.

## Algorithms Included.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- KFold Cross-Validation
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Bagging
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost
- KMeans Clustering (Updated Feb 21, 2024)
- DBSCAN Clustering (Updated Feb 21, 2024)

Each algorithm is implemented clearly, making it easy for learners and practitioners to grasp the fundamental principles of machine learning.

## Getting Started.

- To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

  `git clone https://github.com/cencencendi/ML_FROM_SCRATCH.git`

- Please make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed using Python 3.10.6 but should be compatible with other Python 3 versions. Additionally, you may need to install some dependencies:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Now you can experiment with machine learning algorithms using the sample code and sample datasets in csv format I provided.

Have a nice day!
